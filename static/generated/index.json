    "prompt": "Documentary-style editorial photograph of a tour manager and a small team reviewing printed venue diagrams and notes backstage at a mid-sized music venue. The group is seated around a table with coffee cups, notebooks, and rolled posters, illuminated by warm natural window light. The setting is a clean, well-lit backstage lounge with subtle venue details visible in the background. The mood is focused and collaborative, with engaged expressions, open postures, and gentle gestures of explanation. The composition uses medium distance for an intimate yet contextual view, with layered depth and natural environmental framing. Professional but approachable atmosphere, diverse group, authentic industry moment—no visible screens, no tech, no text, no abstract elements.",
